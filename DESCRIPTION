Description: A set of functions designed to calculate the standardised
    precipitation and standardised precipitation evapotranspiration indices
    using NASA POWER data as described in Blain et al. (2023)
    <doi:10.2139/ssrn.4442843>.  These indices are calculated using a reference
    data source.  The functions verify if the indices' estimates meet the
    assumption of normality and how well NASA POWER estimates represent
    real-world data.  Indices are calculated in a routine mode.  Potential
    evapotranspiration amounts and the difference between rainfall and potential
    evapotranspiration are also calculated.  The functions adopt a basic time
    scale that splits each month into four periods.  Days 1 to 7, days 8 to 14,
    days 15 to 21, and days 22 to 28, 29, 30, or 31, where 'TS=4' corresponds to
    a 1-month length moving window (calculated 4 times per month) and 'TS=48'
    corresponds to a 12-month length moving window (calculated 4 times per
    month).
